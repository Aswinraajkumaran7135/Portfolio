## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark electric blue (#51D0DE), balancing a tech feel with approachability and personality. The hue evokes modern design trends.
- Background color: Almost black (#0A0D0D). Chosen to create a dark theme for increased legibility. Note that dark themes can have accessibility benefits.
- Accent color: Yellow-tinged electric green (#B6FA73), as an analogous contrast that serves to attract attention. Avoids pure white, which can cause eye strain, without going too far towards a dull, desaturated off-white.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font to create a professional appearance.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for skills and categories. The iconography should contribute to overall clean and contemporary design.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to ensure the portfolio is well-organized and easy to navigate.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as hover effects on project cards and smooth scrolling.
